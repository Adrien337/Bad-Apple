Eternal peaceful solitude, internal deafening screams.
Our only hope, a single glimpse at freedom.
Curiosity, forbidden by one’s self, turning into absolute, unrelenting dedication.
Haunting memories, sparking the creation of something truly beautiful...
...after years and years of exploration.
Depression, always present, until you learn how to truly trust someone.
You can sink into serenity... until you are ready to revisit the world once again.
Heart beating, after being beaten; quiet, but steady, always there with you.
Realization after realization.. Until you are ready, for parting with the endless darkness.
And you will find true love.
Past the point of no return, with almost absolute certainty, forever falling in the bottomless abyss of your own complexity and beauty.
And so, let ourselves reunify...
And let this be our Final Goodbye!
